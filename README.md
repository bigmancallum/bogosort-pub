# Bogosort

## What?
Bogosort is a sorting algorithm. Get a list and randomise it. Is the list sorted? Great, you're done! If not, repeat.

## Why?
I originally found out about this sorting algorithm from [a Tom Scott video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGuJga2Gl_k). I thought it would be fun to create it in Python. So I did. It was alright.

## More?
I am in the process of adding a timer to show how long it takes to sort the list. I am also adding error handling, and avoidance of repeats in random lists.
